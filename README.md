# RMQ With Shift
In the traditional RMQ (Range Minimum Query) problem,
we have a static array A. Then for each query (L, R) (L<=R), we report the minimum value among A[L], A[L+1], …, A[R]. Note that the indices start from 1, i.e. the left-most element is A[1].
In this problem, the array A is no longer static: we need to support another operation shift(i1, i2, i3, …, ik) (i1<i2<...<ik, k>1): we do a left "circular shift" of A[i1], A[i2], …, A[ik].<br>

For example, if A={6, 2, 4, 8, 5, 1, 4}, then shift(2, 4, 5, 7) yields {6, 8, 4, 5, 4, 1, 2}. After that, shift(1,2) yields {8, 6, 4, 5, 4, 1, 2}.

Input<br>
There will be only one test case, beginning with two integers n, q (1<=n<=100,000, 1<=q<=120,000), the number of integers in array A, and the number of operations. The next line contains n positive integers not greater than 100,000, the initial elements in array A. Each of the next q lines contains an operation. Each operation is formatted as a string having no more than 30 characters, with no space characters inside. All operations are guaranteed to be valid. Warning: The dataset is large, better to use faster I/O methods.

Output<br>
For each query, print the minimum value (rather than index) in the requested range.
